Once upon a time, there lived an old couple in a small village.
One day the old wife was washing her clothes in the river when a huge peach came tumbling down the stream.
The old woman brought the peach home and cut it up to share with her husband.
To their great surprise, a healthy baby boy came right out of the peach!
The old couple said, “Let’s name him Momotaro (Peach-boy) as he was born from a peach.”
They brought him up with love and care.
Momo-taro grew up rapidly into a strong boy.
One day, he said to the old couple,
“Dear Grandma and Grandpa, I am going to fight and kill evil demons.”
The old couple made some millet dumplings for Momo-taro to take with him
